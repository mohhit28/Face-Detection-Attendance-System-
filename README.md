# Face-Detection-Checkpoint-
A face detection checkpoint is a critical component in facial recognition systems. It involves the use of algorithms and models to detect and extract facial features from images or video frames1. The checkpoint ensures that the detected face meets certain criteria before proceeding to further stages, such as recognition or verification. This process helps in accurately identifying and verifying individuals by analyzing facial landmarks, expressions, and other biometric data.
